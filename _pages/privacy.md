# Look Busy Privacy Policy

Last Updated May 27, 2019

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how AGB Consulting Group (“Look Busy” or "this application" or “we” or “our” or “us”) collects, stores, shares, and uses information, and your choices about privacy when you use our website, products, and services (collectively, “Services”). By accessing or using our Services in any way, you agree that your information may be collected, stored, shared, and used as described in this Policy and our Terms of Use.

## When This Policy Applies

This Policy applies to all of our Services, regardless of how you use them. This Policy does not apply to any entity that we do not own or control, or to any person that we do not employ or manage. If, at any time during the course of using our Services, you are directed to a third-party site, you understand and agree that the policies of the third-party site govern.

> For example, if you use this app to create a calendar event on your iCloud calendar, Apple's iCloud privacy policy will apply to that data.

## Information We Process

We collect information you provide via iOS, such as:

- which language your device is set to
- which calendars are currently configured
- which calendars can be written to
- preexisting events on these calendars (to avoid conflicts)

We might also collect your contact information, for example if you contact us directly.

## How we use this information

- to provide our Services to you, including new Services we develop later (reason: legitimate business purpose and performance of a contract);
- to provide you with customer support (reason: legitimate business purpose);
- to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our Terms of Use or any other policies or agreements with Users (reason: compliance with a legal obligation);

## Who do we share personal info with?

Unless you contact us, we don't have access to your personal contact information.

Calendar information is shared through iOS, potentially to third parties like iCloud, Google Calendar, and Outlook, depending on which calendars you have set up on your device.

We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personal Information and/or other information if we believe that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with any law, regulation, legal process or governmental request (such as search warrants, subpoenas or court orders), which may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside the United States; (ii) enforce our Terms of Use or our other policies or agreements with Users, or investigate potential violations; (iii) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; (iv) protect or enforce the rights or property of Artsy, you, or any other person or entity; or (v) prevent physical harm to any person, including situations involving possible violence or self-harm.

We never sell or otherwise share your personal information, even in aggregate.

## What about children?

Children don't usually maintain complex calendars, and our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from people in this age group. If you believe we may have collected Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13, please contact us.

## Accessing or correcting your Personal Information

We will honor any statutory right you may have to access or correct your Personal Information that we have in our records, and you can email such requests to privacy@aaronbrager.com. Once we receive your request, we will let you know if an administrative fee will apply to fulfill your request, as permitted by applicable law. However, please note that even if you have a legal right to request access to information or to correct information, as permitted by applicable law, we may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, would require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or materially changing an existing practice), would jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical to fulfill (for example, requests to access information located on backup systems).

## Contact Info

Contact privacy@aaronbrager.com if you have questions.
